Questions
=========

* We have about 20 terrabytes of climate data representing global daily temp and precip from the 21 models in the NASA BCSD data. 


* NetCDF is our core data model and we have used Xarray on a few parts of the project. We want to use it throughout the pipeline


* We have have access to 32 cores on an EC2 like system at the Open Science Data Cloud. 


* I am researching different approaches in the community for handling distributed climate computation and when reading one of the github issues on Xarray repo I saw this workshop mentioned and followed. I am here to learn and see what I can bring back to my team.
