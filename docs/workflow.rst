Questions and Issues
====================


* Around a dozen econometricians research and define climate impact functions

  * Stata, Matlab, Python, Julia, R


* Most of code is single-user code. Documentation is unreliable. 


* HPC at Berkeley and EC2 like cluster at Open Science Data Cloud


* S3 store on Open Science Data Cloud as well as NAS where all the data currently lives


* Redesign pipeline to use xarray, dask. Currently using xarray on `margins <https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/metacsv>`_

* We are a public-facing organization. Medium to long-term intent is to create and participate in open-source software for climate impact modeling. 

* Transparency as primary objective: Data and analysis will be used by scientists, policy makers and public
