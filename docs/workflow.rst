Workflow
========


* Around a dozen econometricians research and define climate impact functions

  * Stata, Matlab, Python, Julia, R


* We have about 20 terrabytes of climate data representing global daily temp and precip from the 21 models in the NASA BCSD data. 


* NetCDF is our core data model and we have used Xarray on a few parts of the project. We want to use it throughout the pipeline. 


* We have have access to HPC at Berkeley and an underutilized EC2 like cluster at the Open Science Data Cloud. Our idea is to move everything to the Open Science Data Cloud 


* I am researching different approaches in the community for handling distributed climate computation and when reading one of the github issues on Xarray repo I saw this workshop mentioned and followed. I am here to learn and see what I can bring back to my team.
