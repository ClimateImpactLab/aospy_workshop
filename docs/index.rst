Climate Impact Lab @ AOSPY
==========================================

My name is Justin. I work at `Rhodium Group <http://www.rhg.com>`_.

Today I am going to introduce you to the 
`Climate Impact Lab <http://www.impactlab.org/>`_. I hope to share with you a 
bit of info on its origins, where it is today, where we want to go and how that 
relates to what we are all doing here this weekend.
